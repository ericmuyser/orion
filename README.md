## Accomplishments
Within 24 hours, our team was able to familiarize ourselves with the following web/game development technology to deliver a 2D multiplayer game:
- `node.js` as a basis for our project
- `phaser.io` game engine to do the heavy lifting
- `express.js` to handle routing
- `socket.io` to handle multiplayer

## What We Learned
1. JavaScript & Node.js
2. Understand basic communication between client-side and server-side networks
3. How to stay awake for 24+ hours
